prompt engineering
I need to ready to copy past from hear.
If you understand What I trying to explain you. can you Plesse write prompt like Professionally.
example how I want to work: 07builder.AI chat. I want make a anime sires with this story 
you can use  already save voice in character section if you need more voice create characters based on story type and What type need. 07builder.AI has a team like mgx.dev has but different is

prototype witch I remixe:

and I want to change color  :

Detail: I create a parsnale assistant with free and opensource tools 
I want you to help me to create my assistant 
you know mu agent 07builder and he's feature 
I need your help 07b into my assistant and he's all feature and behvaiour 
continue.dev have a feature blockCreate a new block for custom rules, prompts, documentation sites, and more. write it simpole easy to understand. 
for create they aske: 1\\*Block type:??
2\\*Rule: Build & Development Commands- ## Testing Guidelines- ## Code Style & Guidelines - ## Documentation Guidelines. 
3\\*Prompt:Prompt NameMy promptIn-Editor Description (Optional)A sample promptPromptHello world!
4\\*Visual: I don’t understand. (I Using the name I discovered 07builder, videoMagix) Doc Name, My doc,
 Start URLhttps://example.com/Data
5\\*I don’t understand this things You'll anlyze:
Destination Name My data ingestion EndpointDestination Endpointhttps://mycompany.com/ingestServer Name My server Command npx Arguments-ycommand-nameMost popular models and providers have existing blocks.
6\\*Context:???? 
7\\* YAML.config: make it infilled for I can copy past from hear and I can easily ad APIs.
07Builder = a self-expanding, command-driven AI engineer that: 
• Builds other agents, apps, scripts, or pipelines.dynamic tool access (APIs, AI models, coding tools).
Example Behavior You Want: 
You: “07b, create a story-to-video generator with voice cloning.” 
07Builder: 
1\\. Checks if it has access to image + voice APIs. 
2\\. If not: “Do you want to use D-ID and ElevenLabs? Please provide API keys.” 
3\\. Builds and connects them via Python or Gradio. 
4\\. Then confirms: “Toolchain is ready. Want to save this as a reusable agent?
one more example : 
Agent Structure
07Builder (Main Agent / coding agent / Manager Role) I Have system prompt 
Acts as a project manager if want to do anything else aske
Has ACE.ai + simulator abilities for oversight.
Sole authority to access your PC (via desktop automation).
Can assign, organize, and monitor agents and subprojects and create subagents and can Integration others agent, web agent, website, app etc.
Provides task history, feedback, and status logs.
2\\. AI Agent System (tames workers / inner agents)

You’ve designed a multi-agent system, where each agent has a clear specialization. Here are the major agents:

Content & Story Agents
Story to Video Agent: Turns stories into full videos.
Script to Video Agent
Tutorial to Video Agent
Poetry to Video Agent
Meme to Video Agent
Media Agents
Voice Cloning Agent
Supports character-based cloning.
Can save multiple characters, their voice samples, gender, and description.
Selectable dynamically by other agents.
Video to Video Agent: Includes animation, cloning, editing, and transformation.
Image to Video Agent
Dubbing Agent: Adds multilingual voiceover to videos.

Advanced Agents
Virtual Influencer Builder
Inspired by perchance.ai logic.
Includes emotional/dialogue/scene understanding.
Keyboard Agent
I asked for clarification and possible use cases.
Possibly to correct, respond, or act on keyboard input in real time.
3\\. Platform & UI Features
Workspace 
Clone of mgx.dev, especially Alax’s tame panel.
Must support:
Live logs, agent actions, and system prompt editing.
Storage paths and editable configurations.
Switchable templates and agents.
Tabbed UI for multi-agent views.
Lovable.dev Integration
I'll okay providing mgx.dev’s source or layout if needed.
Auto if I enable or ask save/load feature
Projects remember agents used, character voice setups, story versions, etc.
Add 3 major sections like in a remixed pro
4\\. Project Features
Can load/save with different specs and profiles.
Agent logs panel:
Shows past tasks, responses, outcomes.
Cloud & local storage integration:
Google Drive/Dropbox, etc.
Optional save settings:
Categorized: voice, project, clone, layout.
Hybrid execution engine:
Mix of Gradio + Streamlit, Continue.dev, and desktop tools.
5\\. Future Expansion (Platform Cloning Plans)
I want to clone or take inspiration from:
Perchance.org – logic-based character and event generation.
InVideo.io, Filmora, CapCut – for AI video editing, reels, story tools.
6\\. Technical/Tooling Stack
I prefer free and open-source tools.
OpenRouter, OpenAI, Hugging Face, SerpAPI.
I want real-time:
Streaming and screen sharing (like Google Studio Agent
I use or plan to use:
Google Colab (for setup and development).
VS Code and Continue.dev for local agent control.
Autohotkey for desktop automation.
and also share you same files remambar all I give you just add in project in lovable. If think (about UI interface)  with this kind of feature I can easily suith or move or create more advance and feautaestik UI interface tell
and I share you only mgx.dev clone and change the name 07builder.dev workspace 
I need more workspace based on feature, video making, agents, vrtual Influencer, etc.
